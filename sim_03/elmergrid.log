Moving bulk elements to boundary elements
Assuming that boundaries names are already Ok!
Leading bulk elementtype is 303
Trailing bulk elementtype is 202
There are 528 (out of 22792) lower dimensional elements.
Node 631 belongs to maximum of 8 elements
Found correctly 528 side elements.
Parent elements were reordered up to index 22264.
Moved 22264 elements (out of 22792) to new positions
Successfully read the mesh from the Gmsh input file lib2d_03.msh
Using physical numbering of entities

Elmergrid creating and manipulating meshes:
-------------------------------------------
Bounding box of all nodes in mesh:
X:[0,10] Y:[0,10] Z:[0,0]
Calculate Mesh Pieces in mesh:
There is a single piece in the mesh, so the mesh is conforming.

Elmergrid saving data with method 2:
-------------------------------------
Saving mesh in ElmerSolver format to directory lib2d_03.
Saving 11395 coordinates to mesh.nodes.
Saving 22264 element topologies to mesh.elements.
Saving boundary elements to mesh.boundary.
Saving header info to mesh.header.
Saving names info to mesh.names.
Saving entities info to entities.sif.
